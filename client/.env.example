# API Configuration

# The base URL for the backend API
# NOTE: This is ONLY used in PRODUCTION mode
# In development mode, the app automatically uses http://localhost:3000
#
# For production deployment, create a .env.production file and set:
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
#
# For development, you don't need to set this at all!

# Example for production:
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
